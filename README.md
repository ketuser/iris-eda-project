# Iris Flower EDA: Exploring Species Classification

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris dataset to identify patterns in flower measurements for species classification.
showcasing Python analytics, visualizations (including 3D Plotly scatter), and SQL. 
Note: The 3D Plotly plot is not rendered on GitHub, but it works locally in Jupyter.

## Problem Statement
Analyze sepal and petal measurements to uncover features that distinguish Iris species, using Python, SQL, and visualizations.

## Setup
- Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/ketuser/iris-eda-project.git`
- Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run: `jupyter notebook eda.ipynb`

## Key Skills
- Data Analytics (Python, Pandas)
- Visualization (Seaborn, Plotly 3D)
- SQL (pandasql)
- Git for version control

## Key Findings
- Petal length/width distinguishes Setosa; Versicolor/Virginica overlap.
- 3D scatter confirms Setosaâ€™s tight cluster; petal dimensions key for classification.
